# Next-State-Logic
Next state logic examples using both Gates and ROM
This repository is about understanding how NSL (Next State Logic) works with an environment of both Gates and Rom, this is most a work we do manage to understand 
on an introductory course of Arquitecture of Computers.

We will find two .cpp archives with its respective code on it, feel free to use it! :)
